Shurlock is a powerful Chrome Extension designed to provide comprehensive security analysis of websites you visit. 
It acts as your digital guardian, performing real-time checks on various aspects of a URL to help you identify and avoid potentially dangerous or suspicious websites

ðŸš€ Installation
Since Shurlock is currently a developer extension (not yet on the Chrome Web Store), you'll need to load it manually:

Download the repository:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/shurlock.git

Or, download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extract it to a folder.

Open Chrome Extensions page:

Open Chrome.

Type chrome://extensions in the address bar and press Enter.


Alternatively, click on the three-dot menu (â‹®) in the top-right corner, then go to More tools > Extensions.

Enable Developer mode:

In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, toggle on the "Developer mode" switch.

Load unpacked extension:

Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.


Navigate to the folder where you extracted/cloned the Shurlock repository (the folder containing manifest.json).

Select the folder and click "Select Folder".

Shurlock will now be installed and appear in your extensions list. You should see its icon in your browser's toolbar.


ðŸ’¡ Usage
Using Shurlock is straightforward:
Navigate to a website: Simply browse the internet as you normally would. Shurlock will automatically perform a scan when a new HTTP/HTTPS page loads.

Click the Shurlock icon: Click on the Shurlock shield icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup.
View Scan Results:

The Status Card provides an overall assessment (Safe, Warning, Dangerous, Scanning, Error) and a brief summary.
The Risk Meter visually represents the overall risk score.

Quick Stats show the status of key checks like Safe Browsing, SSL Certificate, and Domain Trust.
Download Detailed Report: Click the "Download Report" button to save a comprehensive HTML file detailing all aspects of the scan.
